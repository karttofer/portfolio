    I remember the moment when I had the conversation that would completely change my life. A friend
    from school gave me the great idea of becoming a video game programmer. I remember that at that
    time, he mentioned that we should first enroll in a degree program to start programming. I
    didn't follow that advice and began to research on my own.

    It wasn't until 2019 that I completely changed my goal and decided to become a Frontend
    Developer. Since then, I haven't stopped working and striving to improve every day as a
    developer.
